Amazon_Pricefinder

Run the amazon_price_finder.py using command "python amazon_price_finder.py" 
The price finder script will take ASIN codes from "productASIN.csv" and look each item up in Amazon.com and return the current selling price and product name. It will also tell the on/offline status by return "#### is offline"

All the return status will be stored in "Amazonaudit.xlsx"

Enjoy....
